For installing TypeScript:
`npm i -g typescript`

For avoiding the recursive task of running the transpiler on each change the TypeScript compiler `tsc` can "watche" for changes to your TypeScript files by running:
`tsc fileName.ts -w`

The rootDir is set to /src folder and the outDir is set to /dist folder in the tsconfing.json file."# totally-typescript"
